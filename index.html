      content="The keingarten project aims to provide access to a natural area and enable people without their own garden to participate in its design. The project promotes practical implementations for climate adaptation and opportunities for sustainable consumption. An former garden house on an agricultural land in Stuttgart-Feuerbach serves as a real-life laboratory."
